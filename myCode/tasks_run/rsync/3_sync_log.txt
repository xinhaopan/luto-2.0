< 2025-02-15 22:20:32.642 Feb 4 Scheduled Maintenance
< 2025-02-15 22:20:32.642    Gadi will be down for scheduled maintenance from 8:00am 4th February, 2025
< 2025-02-15 22:20:32.643    to 6:00pm 4th February, 2025. Jobs that run into this time period will not
< 2025-02-15 22:20:32.643    be launched until after the scheduled downtime. Access to Gadi will be
< 2025-02-15 22:20:32.644    restored as quickly as possible following the downtime.
< 2025-02-15 22:20:32.644    Update 17:25: Gadi has returned to service and is processing jobs.
< 2025-02-15 22:20:32.644 Feb 10 Reduced Capacity for Cooling Works
< 2025-02-15 22:20:32.645    The "normal" and "express" queues will be operating at reduced capacity
< 2025-02-15 22:20:32.645    from February 10, 2025 for up to 2 weeks while essential works are completed
< 2025-02-15 22:20:32.646    on the cooling system for these queues. Queue wait times for these queues
< 2025-02-15 22:20:32.646    may increase during this time. We recommend that users consider other queues
< 2025-02-15 22:20:32.646    if necessary, such as the normalsr and expresssr queues.
< 2025-02-15 22:20:32.647 Feb 13 12:30 Massdata Recall Issues
< 2025-02-15 22:20:32.647    Recalls from massdata are currently hanging for some users. NCI staff are
< 2025-02-15 22:20:32.647    working with the vendor to resolve the issue as soon as possible. PBS jobs
< 2025-02-15 22:20:32.648    requesting massdata will not start while we investigate.
< 2025-02-15 22:20:32.648    Update Feb 14 14:00: The recall issues have been resolved and jobs 
< 2025-02-15 22:20:32.648    are running.

< 2025-02-16 00:20:35.747    Gadi will be down for scheduled maintenance from 8:00am 4th February, 2025
< 2025-02-16 00:20:35.748    to 6:00pm 4th February, 2025. Jobs that run into this time period will not

< 2025-02-16 00:20:35.749    restored as quickly as possible following the downtime.
< 2025-02-16 00:20:35.749    Update 17:25: Gadi has returned to service and is processing jobs.

< 2025-02-16 00:20:35.751    may increase during this time. We recommend that users consider other queues
< 2025-02-16 00:20:35.751    if necessary, such as the normalsr and expresssr queues.

< 2025-02-16 02:20:34.587 Feb 4 Scheduled Maintenance
< 2025-02-16 02:20:34.587    Gadi will be down for scheduled maintenance from 8:00am 4th February, 2025
< 2025-02-16 02:20:34.588    to 6:00pm 4th February, 2025. Jobs that run into this time period will not
< 2025-02-16 02:20:34.588    be launched until after the scheduled downtime. Access to Gadi will be
< 2025-02-16 02:20:34.589    restored as quickly as possible following the downtime.
< 2025-02-16 02:20:34.589    Update 17:25: Gadi has returned to service and is processing jobs.
< 2025-02-16 02:20:34.589 Feb 10 Reduced Capacity for Cooling Works
< 2025-02-16 02:20:34.589    The "normal" and "express" queues will be operating at reduced capacity
< 2025-02-16 02:20:34.589    from February 10, 2025 for up to 2 weeks while essential works are completed
< 2025-02-16 02:20:34.590    on the cooling system for these queues. Queue wait times for these queues
< 2025-02-16 02:20:34.590    may increase during this time. We recommend that users consider other queues
< 2025-02-16 02:20:34.590    if necessary, such as the normalsr and expresssr queues.

< 2025-02-16 02:20:34.592    requesting massdata will not start while we investigate.
< 2025-02-16 02:20:34.592    Update Feb 14 14:00: The recall issues have been resolved and jobs

< 2025-02-16 05:20:30.905    to 6:00pm 4th February, 2025. Jobs that run into this time period will not

< 2025-02-16 05:20:30.905    restored as quickly as possible following the downtime.
< 2025-02-16 05:20:30.906    Update 17:25: Gadi has returned to service and is processing jobs.

< 2025-02-16 06:20:32.906    Gadi will be down for scheduled maintenance from 8:00am 4th February, 2025
< 2025-02-16 06:20:32.906    to 6:00pm 4th February, 2025. Jobs that run into this time period will not
< 2025-02-16 06:20:32.906    be launched until after the scheduled downtime. Access to Gadi will be
< 2025-02-16 06:20:32.907    restored as quickly as possible following the downtime.
< 2025-02-16 06:20:32.907    Update 17:25: Gadi has returned to service and is processing jobs.
< 2025-02-16 06:20:32.907 Feb 10 Reduced Capacity for Cooling Works
< 2025-02-16 06:20:32.907    The "normal" and "express" queues will be operating at reduced capacity
< 2025-02-16 06:20:32.908    from February 10, 2025 for up to 2 weeks while essential works are completed
< 2025-02-16 06:20:32.908    on the cooling system for these queues. Queue wait times for these queues
< 2025-02-16 06:20:32.908    may increase during this time. We recommend that users consider other queues
< 2025-02-16 06:20:32.909    if necessary, such as the normalsr and expresssr queues.

< 2025-02-16 09:20:21.688 Feb 10 Reduced Capacity for Cooling Works
< 2025-02-16 09:20:21.688    The "normal" and "express" queues will be operating at reduced capacity
< 2025-02-16 09:20:21.688    from February 10, 2025 for up to 2 weeks while essential works are completed
< 2025-02-16 09:20:21.689    on the cooling system for these queues. Queue wait times for these queues
< 2025-02-16 09:20:21.689    may increase during this time. We recommend that users consider other queues
< 2025-02-16 09:20:21.689    if necessary, such as the normalsr and expresssr queues.

< 2025-02-16 09:20:21.691    Recalls from massdata are currently hanging for some users. NCI staff are
< 2025-02-16 09:20:21.691    working with the vendor to resolve the issue as soon as possible. PBS jobs
< 2025-02-16 09:20:21.691    requesting massdata will not start while we investigate.

< 2025-02-16 11:20:25.390    Gadi will be down for scheduled maintenance from 8:00am 4th February, 2025
< 2025-02-16 11:20:25.391    to 6:00pm 4th February, 2025. Jobs that run into this time period will not

< 2025-02-16 11:20:25.391    restored as quickly as possible following the downtime.
< 2025-02-16 11:20:25.392    Update 17:25: Gadi has returned to service and is processing jobs.

< 2025-02-16 12:20:26.025    to 6:00pm 4th February, 2025. Jobs that run into this time period will not

< 2025-02-16 13:20:20.813 ===============================================================================
< 2025-02-16 13:20:20.813 Feb 4 Scheduled Maintenance
< 2025-02-16 13:20:20.813    Gadi will be down for scheduled maintenance from 8:00am 4th February, 2025
< 2025-02-16 13:20:20.813    to 6:00pm 4th February, 2025. Jobs that run into this time period will not
< 2025-02-16 13:20:20.814    be launched until after the scheduled downtime. Access to Gadi will be
< 2025-02-16 13:20:20.814    restored as quickly as possible following the downtime.
< 2025-02-16 13:20:20.814    Update 17:25: Gadi has returned to service and is processing jobs.
< 2025-02-16 13:20:20.814 Feb 10 Reduced Capacity for Cooling Works
< 2025-02-16 13:20:20.815    The "normal" and "express" queues will be operating at reduced capacity
< 2025-02-16 13:20:20.815    from February 10, 2025 for up to 2 weeks while essential works are completed
< 2025-02-16 13:20:20.815    on the cooling system for these queues. Queue wait times for these queues
< 2025-02-16 13:20:20.815    may increase during this time. We recommend that users consider other queues
< 2025-02-16 13:20:20.816    if necessary, such as the normalsr and expresssr queues.
< 2025-02-16 13:20:20.816 Feb 13 12:30 Massdata Recall Issues
< 2025-02-16 13:20:20.816    Recalls from massdata are currently hanging for some users. NCI staff are
< 2025-02-16 13:20:20.816    working with the vendor to resolve the issue as soon as possible. PBS jobs
< 2025-02-16 13:20:20.817    requesting massdata will not start while we investigate.
< 2025-02-16 13:20:20.817    Update Feb 14 14:00: The recall issues have been resolved and jobs 
< 2025-02-16 13:20:20.817    are running.

< 2025-02-16 17:20:37.338 Feb 4 Scheduled Maintenance
< 2025-02-16 17:20:37.338    Gadi will be down for scheduled maintenance from 8:00am 4th February, 2025
< 2025-02-16 17:20:37.338    to 6:00pm 4th February, 2025. Jobs that run into this time period will not
< 2025-02-16 17:20:37.339    be launched until after the scheduled downtime. Access to Gadi will be
< 2025-02-16 17:20:37.340    restored as quickly as possible following the downtime.
< 2025-02-16 17:20:37.340    Update 17:25: Gadi has returned to service and is processing jobs.
< 2025-02-16 17:20:37.340 Feb 10 Reduced Capacity for Cooling Works
< 2025-02-16 17:20:37.340    The "normal" and "express" queues will be operating at reduced capacity
< 2025-02-16 17:20:37.340    from February 10, 2025 for up to 2 weeks while essential works are completed
< 2025-02-16 17:20:37.341    on the cooling system for these queues. Queue wait times for these queues
< 2025-02-16 17:20:37.341    may increase during this time. We recommend that users consider other queues
< 2025-02-16 17:20:37.341    if necessary, such as the normalsr and expresssr queues.

< 2025-02-16 17:20:37.342    Recalls from massdata are currently hanging for some users. NCI staff are
< 2025-02-16 17:20:37.342    working with the vendor to resolve the issue as soon as possible. PBS jobs
< 2025-02-16 17:20:37.343    requesting massdata will not start while we investigate.
< 2025-02-16 17:20:37.343    Update Feb 14 14:00: The recall issues have been resolved and jobs 
< 2025-02-16 17:20:37.343    are running.

< 2025-02-16 21:20:24.079    Gadi will be down for scheduled maintenance from 8:00am 4th February, 2025
< 2025-02-16 21:20:24.079    to 6:00pm 4th February, 2025. Jobs that run into this time period will not
< 2025-02-16 21:20:24.079    be launched until after the scheduled downtime. Access to Gadi will be
< 2025-02-16 21:20:24.080    restored as quickly as possible following the downtime.
< 2025-02-16 21:20:24.080    Update 17:25: Gadi has returned to service and is processing jobs.
< 2025-02-16 21:20:24.081 Feb 10 Reduced Capacity for Cooling Works
< 2025-02-16 21:20:24.081    The "normal" and "express" queues will be operating at reduced capacity
< 2025-02-16 21:20:24.081    from February 10, 2025 for up to 2 weeks while essential works are completed
< 2025-02-16 21:20:24.084    on the cooling system for these queues. Queue wait times for these queues
< 2025-02-16 21:20:24.084    may increase during this time. We recommend that users consider other queues
< 2025-02-16 21:20:24.084    if necessary, such as the normalsr and expresssr queues.

< 2025-02-16 22:20:28.251    Gadi will be down for scheduled maintenance from 8:00am 4th February, 2025
< 2025-02-16 22:20:28.252    to 6:00pm 4th February, 2025. Jobs that run into this time period will not

< 2025-02-16 23:20:25.551    Gadi will be down for scheduled maintenance from 8:00am 4th February, 2025
< 2025-02-16 23:20:25.551    to 6:00pm 4th February, 2025. Jobs that run into this time period will not

< 2025-02-16 23:20:25.551    restored as quickly as possible following the downtime.
< 2025-02-16 23:20:25.553    Update 17:25: Gadi has returned to service and is processing jobs.

< 2025-02-17 00:20:30.434    Gadi will be down for scheduled maintenance from 8:00am 4th February, 2025
< 2025-02-17 00:20:30.435    to 6:00pm 4th February, 2025. Jobs that run into this time period will not

< 2025-02-17 00:20:30.435    restored as quickly as possible following the downtime.
< 2025-02-17 00:20:30.435    Update 17:25: Gadi has returned to service and is processing jobs.

< 2025-02-17 01:20:34.657 Feb 4 Scheduled Maintenance
< 2025-02-17 01:20:34.658    Gadi will be down for scheduled maintenance from 8:00am 4th February, 2025
< 2025-02-17 01:20:34.658    to 6:00pm 4th February, 2025. Jobs that run into this time period will not
< 2025-02-17 01:20:34.658    be launched until after the scheduled downtime. Access to Gadi will be
< 2025-02-17 01:20:34.659    restored as quickly as possible following the downtime.
< 2025-02-17 01:20:34.659    Update 17:25: Gadi has returned to service and is processing jobs.
< 2025-02-17 01:20:34.659 Feb 10 Reduced Capacity for Cooling Works
< 2025-02-17 01:20:34.660    The "normal" and "express" queues will be operating at reduced capacity
< 2025-02-17 01:20:34.660    from February 10, 2025 for up to 2 weeks while essential works are completed
< 2025-02-17 01:20:34.661    on the cooling system for these queues. Queue wait times for these queues
< 2025-02-17 01:20:34.661    may increase during this time. We recommend that users consider other queues
< 2025-02-17 01:20:34.661    if necessary, such as the normalsr and expresssr queues.

< 2025-02-17 02:20:22.420    Gadi will be down for scheduled maintenance from 8:00am 4th February, 2025
< 2025-02-17 02:20:22.420    to 6:00pm 4th February, 2025. Jobs that run into this time period will not

< 2025-02-17 03:20:40.655    to 6:00pm 4th February, 2025. Jobs that run into this time period will not

< 2025-02-17 03:20:40.655    restored as quickly as possible following the downtime.
< 2025-02-17 03:20:40.656    Update 17:25: Gadi has returned to service and is processing jobs.

< 2025-02-17 04:20:30.011 Feb 10 Reduced Capacity for Cooling Works
< 2025-02-17 04:20:30.011    The "normal" and "express" queues will be operating at reduced capacity
< 2025-02-17 04:20:30.011    from February 10, 2025 for up to 2 weeks while essential works are completed
< 2025-02-17 04:20:30.011    on the cooling system for these queues. Queue wait times for these queues
< 2025-02-17 04:20:30.011    may increase during this time. We recommend that users consider other queues
< 2025-02-17 04:20:30.011    if necessary, such as the normalsr and expresssr queues.

< 2025-02-17 04:20:30.013    Recalls from massdata are currently hanging for some users. NCI staff are
< 2025-02-17 04:20:30.013    working with the vendor to resolve the issue as soon as possible. PBS jobs
< 2025-02-17 04:20:30.013    requesting massdata will not start while we investigate.

< 2025-02-17 05:20:24.629    to 6:00pm 4th February, 2025. Jobs that run into this time period will not

< 2025-02-17 06:20:26.969    Gadi will be down for scheduled maintenance from 8:00am 4th February, 2025
< 2025-02-17 06:20:26.970    to 6:00pm 4th February, 2025. Jobs that run into this time period will not

< 2025-02-17 06:20:26.970    restored as quickly as possible following the downtime.
< 2025-02-17 06:20:26.971    Update 17:25: Gadi has returned to service and is processing jobs.

< 2025-02-17 08:20:19.697 ===============================================================================
< 2025-02-17 08:20:19.697 Feb 4 Scheduled Maintenance
< 2025-02-17 08:20:19.698    Gadi will be down for scheduled maintenance from 8:00am 4th February, 2025
< 2025-02-17 08:20:19.698    to 6:00pm 4th February, 2025. Jobs that run into this time period will not
< 2025-02-17 08:20:19.698    be launched until after the scheduled downtime. Access to Gadi will be
< 2025-02-17 08:20:19.699    restored as quickly as possible following the downtime.
< 2025-02-17 08:20:19.699    Update 17:25: Gadi has returned to service and is processing jobs.
< 2025-02-17 08:20:19.699 Feb 10 Reduced Capacity for Cooling Works
< 2025-02-17 08:20:19.699    The "normal" and "express" queues will be operating at reduced capacity
< 2025-02-17 08:20:19.700    from February 10, 2025 for up to 2 weeks while essential works are completed
< 2025-02-17 08:20:19.700    on the cooling system for these queues. Queue wait times for these queues
< 2025-02-17 08:20:19.700    may increase during this time. We recommend that users consider other queues
< 2025-02-17 08:20:19.701    if necessary, such as the normalsr and expresssr queues.
< 2025-02-17 08:20:19.701 Feb 13 12:30 Massdata Recall Issues
< 2025-02-17 08:20:19.701    Recalls from massdata are currently hanging for some users. NCI staff are
< 2025-02-17 08:20:19.702    working with the vendor to resolve the issue as soon as possible. PBS jobs
< 2025-02-17 08:20:19.702    requesting massdata will not start while we investigate.
< 2025-02-17 08:20:19.702    Update Feb 14 14:00: The recall issues have been resolved and jobs 
< 2025-02-17 08:20:19.702    are running.

< 2025-02-17 09:20:18.888    Gadi will be down for scheduled maintenance from 8:00am 4th February, 2025
< 2025-02-17 09:20:18.888    to 6:00pm 4th February, 2025. Jobs that run into this time period will not

< 2025-02-17 12:20:29.786 Feb 4 Scheduled Maintenance
< 2025-02-17 12:20:29.786    Gadi will be down for scheduled maintenance from 8:00am 4th February, 2025
< 2025-02-17 12:20:29.787    to 6:00pm 4th February, 2025. Jobs that run into this time period will not
< 2025-02-17 12:20:29.787    be launched until after the scheduled downtime. Access to Gadi will be
< 2025-02-17 12:20:29.788    restored as quickly as possible following the downtime.
< 2025-02-17 12:20:29.788    Update 17:25: Gadi has returned to service and is processing jobs.
< 2025-02-17 12:20:29.789 Feb 10 Reduced Capacity for Cooling Works
< 2025-02-17 12:20:29.789    The "normal" and "express" queues will be operating at reduced capacity
< 2025-02-17 12:20:29.790    from February 10, 2025 for up to 2 weeks while essential works are completed
< 2025-02-17 12:20:29.790    on the cooling system for these queues. Queue wait times for these queues
< 2025-02-17 12:20:29.790    may increase during this time. We recommend that users consider other queues
< 2025-02-17 12:20:29.790    if necessary, such as the normalsr and expresssr queues.

< 2025-02-17 12:20:29.791    Recalls from massdata are currently hanging for some users. NCI staff are
< 2025-02-17 12:20:29.792    working with the vendor to resolve the issue as soon as possible. PBS jobs
< 2025-02-17 12:20:29.792    requesting massdata will not start while we investigate.
< 2025-02-17 12:20:29.793    Update Feb 14 14:00: The recall issues have been resolved and jobs 
< 2025-02-17 12:20:29.793    are running.

< 2025-02-17 14:20:37.352    Gadi will be down for scheduled maintenance from 8:00am 4th February, 2025
< 2025-02-17 14:20:37.352    to 6:00pm 4th February, 2025. Jobs that run into this time period will not

< 2025-02-17 16:20:46.450 Feb 4 Scheduled Maintenance
< 2025-02-17 16:20:46.452    Gadi will be down for scheduled maintenance from 8:00am 4th February, 2025
< 2025-02-17 16:20:46.452    to 6:00pm 4th February, 2025. Jobs that run into this time period will not
< 2025-02-17 16:20:46.452    be launched until after the scheduled downtime. Access to Gadi will be
< 2025-02-17 16:20:46.452    restored as quickly as possible following the downtime.
< 2025-02-17 16:20:46.452    Update 17:25: Gadi has returned to service and is processing jobs.
< 2025-02-17 16:20:46.453 Feb 10 Reduced Capacity for Cooling Works
< 2025-02-17 16:20:46.453    The "normal" and "express" queues will be operating at reduced capacity
< 2025-02-17 16:20:46.453    from February 10, 2025 for up to 2 weeks while essential works are completed
< 2025-02-17 16:20:46.453    on the cooling system for these queues. Queue wait times for these queues
< 2025-02-17 16:20:46.453    may increase during this time. We recommend that users consider other queues
< 2025-02-17 16:20:46.453    if necessary, such as the normalsr and expresssr queues.

< 2025-02-17 18:20:38.652    Gadi will be down for scheduled maintenance from 8:00am 4th February, 2025
< 2025-02-17 18:20:38.653    to 6:00pm 4th February, 2025. Jobs that run into this time period will not

< 2025-02-17 18:20:38.653    restored as quickly as possible following the downtime.
< 2025-02-17 18:20:38.654    Update 17:25: Gadi has returned to service and is processing jobs.

< 2025-02-17 19:20:33.702    to 6:00pm 4th February, 2025. Jobs that run into this time period will not

< 2025-02-17 19:20:33.703    restored as quickly as possible following the downtime.
< 2025-02-17 19:20:33.703    Update 17:25: Gadi has returned to service and is processing jobs.

< 2025-02-17 20:20:30.076    Gadi will be down for scheduled maintenance from 8:00am 4th February, 2025
< 2025-02-17 20:20:30.076    to 6:00pm 4th February, 2025. Jobs that run into this time period will not
< 2025-02-17 20:20:30.077    be launched until after the scheduled downtime. Access to Gadi will be
< 2025-02-17 20:20:30.077    restored as quickly as possible following the downtime.
< 2025-02-17 20:20:30.077    Update 17:25: Gadi has returned to service and is processing jobs.
< 2025-02-17 20:20:30.078 Feb 10 Reduced Capacity for Cooling Works
< 2025-02-17 20:20:30.078    The "normal" and "express" queues will be operating at reduced capacity
< 2025-02-17 20:20:30.078    from February 10, 2025 for up to 2 weeks while essential works are completed
< 2025-02-17 20:20:30.079    on the cooling system for these queues. Queue wait times for these queues
< 2025-02-17 20:20:30.079    may increase during this time. We recommend that users consider other queues
< 2025-02-17 20:20:30.079    if necessary, such as the normalsr and expresssr queues.

< 2025-02-17 22:20:25.080    Gadi will be down for scheduled maintenance from 8:00am 4th February, 2025
< 2025-02-17 22:20:25.080    to 6:00pm 4th February, 2025. Jobs that run into this time period will not

< 2025-02-17 22:20:25.082    restored as quickly as possible following the downtime.
< 2025-02-17 22:20:25.082    Update 17:25: Gadi has returned to service and is processing jobs.

< 2025-02-17 23:20:35.753 Feb 10 Reduced Capacity for Cooling Works
< 2025-02-17 23:20:35.753    The "normal" and "express" queues will be operating at reduced capacity
< 2025-02-17 23:20:35.754    from February 10, 2025 for up to 2 weeks while essential works are completed
< 2025-02-17 23:20:35.754    on the cooling system for these queues. Queue wait times for these queues
< 2025-02-17 23:20:35.754    may increase during this time. We recommend that users consider other queues
< 2025-02-17 23:20:35.754    if necessary, such as the normalsr and expresssr queues.

< 2025-02-17 23:20:35.755    Recalls from massdata are currently hanging for some users. NCI staff are

< 2025-02-17 23:20:35.756    are running.
