# Tests

Tests have been included to help ensure the robustness of functionality implemented by the Biarri team. These have been implemented using [pytest](https://docs.pytest.org/en/stable/contents.html), and they make use of [hypothesis](https://hypothesis.readthedocs.io/en/latest/) for property-based testing.

To run the tests, execute `python -m pytest` from the root directory of this repository.
